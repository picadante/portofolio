# PORTFOLIO-PROFESIONAL
This developer portfolio highlights client work and projects developed using skills in browser-based technologies, API design, database schema, and serverside development. All work displays my technical skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PWAs, React.js and back-end implementation via REST, JSON, AJAX, GraphQL, node.js, express.js, and MERN.
- One goal for this portfolio was to heavily use FlexBox as a layout tool and make each portfolio item viewable by any device.
- Rather than have multiple pages for each device, now you can use one page using Flexbox to view on any device screensize.
- Flexbox is one way to create responsive static pages, and used with CSS Grid, more complex and visually engaging layouts can be  created.
